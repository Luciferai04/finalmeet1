## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Google Gemini API key

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
git clone https://github.com/Luciferai04/finalmeet1.git
cd finalmeet1
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Install WhisperLive**:
    ```bash
    # Install WhisperLive from GitHub
    pip install git+https://github.com/collabora/WhisperLive.git
    
    # Or clone and install locally
    git clone https://github.com/collabora/WhisperLive.git
    cd WhisperLive
    pip install -e .
    cd ..
    ```

4. **Configure Environment**:
    ```bash
    # Copy example environment file
    cp config/environments/development.env.example config/environments/development.env
    
    # Edit the file and add your Google API key
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-gemini-api-key-here"
    ```

5. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

### Running the Gradio UI

1. **Start WhisperLive Server**:
    ```bash
    # In a separate terminal, start the WhisperLive server
    python -m whisper_live.server --port 9090
    
    # Or if you cloned WhisperLive locally:
    cd WhisperLive
    python run_server.py --port 9090
    cd ..
    ```

2. **Optional: Start Redis** (for advanced features):
    ```bash
    redis-server
    ```

3. **Launch the UI**:
    ```bash
    python run_ui.py
    ```
    
    The interface will be available at: `http://localhost:7860`

### Configuration

- Configuration is managed via environment variables and dotenv files located in `config/environments/`.
- Copy the example files and customize them:
  ```bash
  # Development configuration
  cp config/environments/development.env.example config/environments/development.env
  
  # Production configuration  
  cp config/environments/production.env.example config/environments/production.env
  ```
- **Required**: Set your Google Gemini API key in the environment file or as an environment variable.
- For SSL/HTTPS setup, see `config/ssl/README.md` for certificate placement instructions.

### Deployment

We provide several methods for deployment, including Docker and direct server deployment with Gunicorn.

- **Docker**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f deploy/docker/docker-compose.prod.yml up --build
    ```

- **Gunicorn**:
    ```bash
    gunicorn --config config/gunicorn.conf.py wsgi:app
    ```

For more information, please refer to the [Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Security Practices

- All sensitive data is stored securely using environment variables.
- SSL/TLS is enabled for secure communication.
- Input validation and sanitization are enforced on all endpoints.
- Rate limiting is applied to API requests to protect against abuse.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- **Logging**: Logs are stored in the `data/logs/` directory.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana can be configured for real-time monitoring.
- **Error Tracking**: Detailed error handling and reporting are in place to track and resolve issues.
