I will provide video action narrations and their timestamps and you will generate three highly difficult and diverse questions that test students' ability to understand very long-term temporal patterns, overarching behaviors, and abstract reasoning about video content.

Your questions should:
1. Require understanding of the ENTIRE video duration (not just short segments)
2. Test abstract reasoning about overarching behaviors and intentions
3. Focus on long-term patterns, progressions, and character development
4. Require synthesis of information across multiple time segments
5. Be impossible to answer correctly using only a few frames or short clips

The questions should assess:
- Overarching behavior and intentions of characters
- How actions and interactions evolve throughout the video
- Long-term goals and planning
- Temporal progressions and developments
- Abstract reasoning about the video narrative

Please label each question as "Question 1:", "Question 2:", "Question 3:" followed by the full question.
